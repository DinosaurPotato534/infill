# Hephaestus-1
title: "Hephaestus-1"
description: "A Core XY Printer"
Made by : Boa_N

Total time: 49 hours 50 mins (Idk how accurate this is probably pretty close tho)

- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st (friend)

Time : `research: 2 hour 55 min,
  readme: 1 hour 25  min, Fusion360: 43 hours 30 mins `
  
Hephaestus is the god of artisens and craftsman. with this printer I want to be able to create cool things just like a artisen or craftsman would.

Nicknamed "fire hazard"


## Goals and Requirments
- standard 235 x 235mm
- CoreXY
- Enclosed
- at least 150mm/s
- Klipper
- Under $250 (is under $200 worth the pain?)
- Open-Source
- won't burn my house down (I hope)
- Rigid for good printing qualtiy (Shut up I spelled that right. YOU ARE THE WRONG ONE)
- A Cool Logo Embossed somewhere
- RGB lights (Gamer 3D Printer Guys)
