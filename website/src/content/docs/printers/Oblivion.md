Total hours so far: 1h

- [X] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st.

## Research & Planning:

### Feb 19th:

#### I made a overall plan:
- CoreXY ( although im not sure if this is the best yet, going to research other systems later crossxy, corexz, variations of bed slingers, etc. )
- Linear rails with V slot wheels maybe?
- Enclosed (idk if abs support would be within budget, but its a potential)
- direct drive, all metal hotend
- MAYBE a diy mmu (something like prusa's) if within budget + time 
- Klipper firmware
