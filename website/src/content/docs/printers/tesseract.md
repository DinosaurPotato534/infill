# Tesseract - Compact Cantilever 3D Printer by Numerius

## Overview
Tesseract is a compact cantilever 3D printer designed to fit within a standard filament box while maximizing build volume. The printer leverages the precision and speed benefits of a  system in a space-efficient cantilever package for optimal space utilization.

## Design Goals
- Implement a motion system for high-speed, precise printing
- Maximize build volume while maintaining compatibility with standard filament box dimensions
- Ensure rigid frame construction for stable high-speed operation
- Maintain simple assembly and maintenance accessibility
- Optimize component layout for compact design

## Key Features
- Motion System: Cantilever kinematics
- Build Volume: Optimized for standard filament box enclosure
- Frame: Rigid aluminum extrusion construction with cantilever design
- Toolhead: Lightweight direct drive extruder

## Project Structure
- `/cad`: Primary CAD design files
- `/cad_imports`: External CAD models and references
- `/electronics`: Electronic components and wiring diagrams
- `/images`: Project documentation images and renders

## Design Inspiration
The project draws inspiration from successful 3D printer implementations, while developing entirely original parts and designs:

###  Inspiration
- Voron Design printers
- RatRig V-Core
- HyperCube Evolution

### Additional Design Influences
- Forge: Printer Optimization
- Positron: Compact layout
- Prusa Mini+: User-friendly design and reliability

## Current Status
The project is in the initial design phase, with focus on:
1.  motion system optimization
2. Frame design for optimal build volume within filament box constraints
3. Electronics selection and layout
4. Toolhead design and optimization

## Next Steps
- Complete initial CAD design
- Finalize electronics configuration
- Develop assembly documentation
- Begin prototyping key components
