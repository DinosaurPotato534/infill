- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

## March 2nd, 2025
5:48pm: Time to start planning. I have literally no idea where to start or what to do, so I betetr figure that out first.

6:26pm: Finished making a basic sketch:

I realised my orginal thought process wasn't actually possible, but I made design #1, where the tall thingys move back and forth. I haven't seen this on a printer before, it's either the build plate moving (not really possible with the constraints) or the extruder moving two ways (again, not entirely possible, but a fold out thing could be possible but very difficult). I think I will stick with this design for now.

Design #2 just another quick idea to test my brain. This does have a moving build plate (conveyor belt!) but I don't think this is the best idea and it has a good chance of not working.

So far, I'm sticking with design #1.

6:38pm: Here are my current goals for this printer:
- To be portable enough to fit in a suitcase
- To be to survive being upside down and some jolting around (but not while printing!)
- To be able to easily plug in and power the print
- To be able to reliably fold and unfold the printer a million times
- To be able to print with millimeter precision
- To be easy enough for an end user to use.

And for some extra goals:
- Have an in-built battery (although, 3D printers take a lot of power so you wouldn't be able to run very long with this)
- Have a touch screen for controlling the printer
- Have a USB-A / micro-SD card slot for sending over designs
- Have in-built storage with a micro-SD card (actually, isn't this a requirement because the printer has to be actively reading this?)

Still have no idea really where to start but to do some research!

6:48pm: Started watching [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdfztjEP_bI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdfztjEP_bI) to 1:53!

**Time elapsed**: 5:48pm - 6:48pm
