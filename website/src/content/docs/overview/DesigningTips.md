description: A collection of tips from dari about designing your printer

Hi there! This page is pretty much going to be a braindump of every useful thing I can think of to put here. Won't be super organized but hopefully it should help

First and foremost: I'm basing this entire YSWS off of my experience with creating Neutrino, and it's more or less what I'm looking for. It's a good reference.


### Actually designing
- First and foremost: PLAN!!! every single one of these steps will require research.
    - Try and find a specific set of goals with your 3D printer. What do you need it to do to call it successful? I.e:
        - be enclosed
        - print exotic materials
        - be solar powered
        - under $X price.
    - Write notes. Create mind maps. Look at what I initially did for Neutrino. Image [here](https://theopenary.com/images/neutrino/neutrinomaphr.png). Everything in there was largely done in a single sitting.
    - Sketch out your design! Draw specific mechanisms, the overall design, etc. It doesn't have to be perfect at all, but it should give you the right idea of what you want to do
- Look at existing 3D printer designs and see what they do and how they come together. SO many of them are open source so it's really useful. It's *alot* and alot of research.
    - Once you have an idea w/ sketches, approx measurements, etc, then you can start your CAD model! It'll take a lot of trial and erorr. Neutrino had over 160+ savefiles
- You can reuse 3D models for off-the-shelf components from other projects to avoid redesigning them. (screws, linear rails,  etc).
