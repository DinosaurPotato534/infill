If you're stuck for ideas, here's some features I've always wanted to see implemented. Feel free to use these for your own

- Hotswap toolheads using Kinematic couplings for cheap
- USB-C powered 3D printer
- 3D printer you can wear on your back somehow
- Conveyor belt 3D printer for infinite prints (I'm doing this!)
- Multi-axis printing for cheap in a well documented way
- Solar panel powered 3D printer

Feel free to make a PR to add to this! It's just a dump of what I'm thinking currently.
