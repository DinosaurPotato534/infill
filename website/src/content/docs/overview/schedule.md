description: How we're going to make it to RMRRF
---

**Feb 1st: Kickoff**
Event launched! Here you are.

**March 31st: Finish your design**
Design should be finished by this point. Order the parts.

**April 14th: Parts should arrive**
All your parts should've arrived by now. You'll need the 2-3 weeks to tune and continue working on your printer.

**May 4th: Printer needs to be fully tuned**
Your benchy should work by now! This is two days ahead of the ship date so you have time to pack it.

**May 6th: Ship everything off**
Everything should be shipped off by this date, if not earlier. Otherwise your printer may not make it to RMRRF. You can take it on your carry-on if you want to avoid shipping and/or think it won't arrive in time.

**May 16th: Fly to RMRRF**
The big moment. Hope I see you there.
