description: A collection of resources and useful links for designing your printer

Here's a collection of resources I've amassed over the years that I found EXTREMELY useful for designing your own 3D printer

It's divided into multiple sections

### Generally useful stuff
- Go over all of [Ellis' 3D print tuning guide](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/) - it'll help you build an intuition of what causes 3D printing issues and why, so that you can design a better printer. It is *the* best resource out there
- Join the discords of people/groups who do custom 3D printers - they're an insanely useful resource because they're entire communities dedicated to a particular set of 3D printer designs, and you will learn SO much just lurking in them
    - VORONDesign
    - Annex Engineering
    - Rolohaun 3D
    - Armchair heavy industries
    - **That being said, please be extremely respectful in these communities! Ultimately they're still dedicated to their respective projects and we don't want to invade / cause drama**
- YouTubers like [CNCKitchen](https://www.youtube.com/cnckitchen), [Thomas Sanladerer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaU8-2XadIE), and others are great to watch because they do tons of experiments with 3D printing - it'll give you inspiration for stuff you want to try out in your own printer.

### Part sourcing
- The [VORONDesign sourcing guide](https://vorondesign.com/sourcing_guide) is the singlehandedly the best one out there IMO
- The [Annex Engineering Souricing guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O3eyVuQ6M4F03MJSDs4Z71_XyNjXL5HFTZr1jsaAtRc/edit?gid=130421369#gid=130421369) is also really useful
- Try to also look at the BOM of other 3D printers and look at where they sourced their parts - it can save you a ton of time digging for prices. Feel free to use Neutrino!
- In general with these lists, it's moreso *where* they're getting their parts then what specifically. I.e if they link a 200mm rail but you need a 150, if its from the same place the quality should still be pretty good!

### 3D models
**Entire 3D printers**
- [VORON Printers](https://github.com/vorondesign). These are 100% the most complete CAD models I have ever come across, please look through them before proceeding
    - [V2.4](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2)
    - [V0](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0)
    - [Trident](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident)
    - [Legacy](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Legacy)
    - [Switchwire](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Switchwire)
- [Neutrino](https://theopenary.com/neutrino)! Made by yours truly.
- [The 100 3D printer](https://github.com/MSzturc/the100)
- [HevORT](https://hevort.com/)
- [The Positron](https://www.positron3d.com/)
- [Printers for ants](https://3dprintersforants.com/)

**Other models**
In general, if you're looking for a spectific part, chances are that it's already been modelled by someone else - you can go through the previous models and dig for the parts.

Here's some I've found over the years:
